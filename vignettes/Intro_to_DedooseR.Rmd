Qualitative projects rarely begin with a dataset that is ready for analysis and
raw Dedoose exports do not include a dedicated ID column. Instead, they arrive
with transcript metadata, coder names, ranges, weights, and one column per code.
This vignette walks through a typical workflow—cleaning excerpts, merging related
codes, and reviewing the underlying text—using three core functions:
`clean_data()`, `recode()`, and `view_excerpts()`. To keep the example fun,
we follow a fictional qualitative study of a summer music camp exploring how
drumming circles and songwriting labs support child development. The mock tibble
below mirrors a Dedoose export so the entire vignette can render without private
files.

    "Keeping the djembe rhythm steady made my hands stronger, and pairing up for call-and-response helped the nervous kids giggle and join in. We counted the measures together like a quick math warmup, and they kept testing new patterns until they could hear their confidence rise.",
    "During the rhythm relay, we practiced breathing between verses so the kids could wait for their cue instead of jumping in early. Mapping the rhymes to eight-count phrases let them chart syllables like a fractions lesson, and when one camper shouted over the group we paused to name the frustration, reset, and talk about how mistakes fuel the next take.",
    "When I get mad now, I write a hook about it first. It helps me spot the feeling, note the anxious thoughts that used to stay bottled up, and decide whether I want to shout it or sing it soft. Drafting verses in my notebook also keeps my reading teacher happy because I'm practicing structure while I hype myself up.",
    "In lyric lab the trio revised their chorus, taking turns so nobody rushed the mic while they jotted rhyme schemes on the whiteboard. Naming which lines sounded brave versus nervous let them cheer each other on, and the rewrites doubled as a grammar check that made them proud to keep refining.",
    "During the campfire reflection, one camper admitted she shuts down when the melody shifts minor while her friend blurts jokes to cover his jitters, so we charted both reactions on the mood wheel. They annotated lyric sheets to spot evidence for those feelings, and sharing coping plans made them feel less alone and more capable.",
    "On practice night we tapped the rim pattern slowly so the shy drummer could breathe through the butterflies and wait for the downbeat before attacking the snare. They tracked tempos in a spreadsheet for homework, proving to themselves that patient repetitions improve control even when anxiety creeps in mid-song.",
    "During the studio session debrief, the counselors noted how Tasha's freestyles shifted from loud interruptions to collaborative echoes once we rehearsed conversation stems. She marked the beats she wanted to emphasize on her lyric worksheet, and bragged that the script gave her confidence without shutting down her big energy.",
    "The teen beat makers synced their keyboard riffs with the drum pad, counting rests together so each person held back until the loop called for them. Charting the chord inversions on staff paper turned into a mini theory lesson, and the crew loved seeing how breathing through the tricky hand switch built real confidence.",
    "Aliyah's notebook shows mood colors beside every verse, and she journals how the sadness feels in her chest before choosing whether to rap or sing the line. She keeps a checklist of revision strategies from literacy class, reminding herself to pause, name the feeling, and try another take until the lyric matches her intention.",
    "In mentor circle today the group mapped conflict scripts, role-playing the kid who shuts down and the kid who pops off. They located sentence starters from our reading packet to practice calm responses, and sharing wins boosted the quieter campers' confidence.",
    "During homework jam we slowed spoken word drafts, pausing at commas to note the emotions driving each line. Writing margin notes about the worry behind certain phrases helped them see how breathing before the final stanza keeps the story clear while they revise.",
    "At the closing showcase interview, Jordan described how the ensemble now checks in with thumbs before feedback so anxious singers feel seen. They referenced the critique rubric like a reading comprehension guide, and noticing their own growth made them stand taller on stage.",
    "While recording harmonies Aliyah plotted fingerings on a tablature grid and waited for the metronome click before sliding into the chorus. Tracking the takes in her practice journal showed how deliberate pacing builds confidence and keeps her chasing new techniques.",
    "Rohan noted that the lunchtime cypher got loud when Jace joked through the tension, so we paused to label the frustration and mark triggers on the behavior chart. Translating that moment into a reflective paragraph later helped Jace feel proud of naming the shift before it exploded again.",
    "In leadership huddle the mentors graphed how their small-group questions improved week to week, even when nerves made them rush. Studying discussion transcripts for evidence of follow-up prompts showed them that practicing new openings pays off.",
    "During peer pairing, Malik clenched up before solos, so we rehearsed counting four silent beats before striking the bell tree. Logging each attempt on a progress chart proved to him that steady breathing and restraint can tame the worry he carries in.",
    "Reflection rounds had artists reread their zine entries, underline words tied to fear or hope, and then rewrite one stanza to show the shift. Sharing those drafts aloud left them buzzing about how revising with evidence from the text made their voices feel stronger.",
    "The new camper interview highlighted how staff coached a quick-to-shout drummer to tap the rim twice before speaking, giving peers room to weigh in. Charting discussion norms on the whiteboard doubled as a literacy task and she beamed about channeling her volume into support.",
    "Goal setting sessions have teens draft personal learning targets, then annotate lyrics to show where they pushed past stage fright. Keeping that evidence log convinces them their writing muscles grow with each revision.",
    "In improvisation lab the facilitator had everyone breathe twice, name the dominant feeling, and raise a hand before adding to the groove. They cited vocabulary from literacy night to explain their choices, and each success at pausing built their belief that they can stretch the next idea even further."

## 1. Clean excerpts with `clean_data()`

The `clean_data()` function standardizes column names, keeps the highest ranked
coder per transcript, drops range/weight columns, prefixes code variables with
`c_`, and returns both the cleaned data and a codebook. Supply the mock data along
with your preferred coder order. If you have single-coded transcripts, you can simply list all your coders here. You can optionally rename and relabel variables
at the same time.

```{r}
# Define your preferred coders ----------------------------------
preferred_coders <- c("Aliyah", "Rohan", "Lina", "Mateo", "Priya", "Jordan")

# Run the function ----------------------------------

cleaned <- clean_data(
  excerpts = demo_excerpts,
  preferred_coders = preferred_coders,
  rename_vars = list(resource_author = "resource_creator"),
  relabel_vars = list(
    media_title = "Interview or focus group title",
    resource_author = "Team member who uploaded to Dedoose"
  )
)

# Take a peeksie! ----------------------------------
cleaned$data
```

Bonus: this function also produces a codebook, which allows you to get an overview of your data and confirm your variable labels and types before moving on.

```{r}
cleaned$codebook
```

## 2. Recode related codes with `recode()`

Qualitative analysis often requires a lot of code iteration. We begin our journey with our research interests in mind, alongside an openness to all else that may emerge. As we understand our data better, we begin to see the patterns in ideas and often decide to tease apart or collapse codes. 

The `recode()` function combines selected codes into a
single logical column and updates the codebook. Here, the two emotion-focused
codes are collapsed into one composite while the remaining themes stay as-is. In similar fashion, you can tease apart codes. 

```{r}
recoded <- DedooseR::recode(
  data = cleaned$data,
  recodes = list(
    c_emotional_growth = c(
      "c_emotional_regulation",
      "c_emotion_identification"
    )
  ),
  relabel_vars = list(
    c_emotional_growth = "emotional growth: identification and/or regulation"
  )
)

recoded$data_recode
```

```{r}
recoded$codebook_recode
```

These two objects—`recoded$data_recode` and `recoded$codebook_recode`—are the ones
we will carry into the follow-up vignette on summarizing codes. Knit this article
first so they are easy to reuse.

## 3. Explore excerpts with `view_excerpts()`

Finally, review the excerpts behind each code. `view_excerpts()` opens an
interactive table powered by `DT`, letting you filter by code and search within
text. 

```{r}
view_excerpts(recoded$data_recode)
```
```{r}
if (requireNamespace("DT", quietly = TRUE)) {
  view_excerpts(recoded$data_recode)
} else {
  message("Install the DT package to launch the interactive excerpt browser.")
}
```

TLDR: Start with `clean_data()` to standardize variable names and labels, recode variables as you iterate on your codebook, and lean on `view_excerpts()` whenever
you want to review the excerpts by code stories behind the summaries.
