# Test 1: the output contains a table and if plot = TRUE, it also contains a plot


# Test 2: the table contains a column named code_count and prop_media_titles, with c_ cols in rows and their variable names in the output
  # the code_counts should be a count of each time a code = TRUE in the dataset
  # prop_media_titles is the number of distinct media titles the code appears in
