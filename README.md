**DedooseR** is an R package that connects with 
[Dedoose](https://www.dedoose.com/) to support the analysis of qualitative data.
It was built to help researchers streamline workflows, explore qualitative data flexibly,
and conduct qualitative coding and analysis with rigor. 

## Key Features

DedooseR currently has 8 key functions that allow you to:

- `clean_data`: standardizes column names, keeps the highest ranked coder per transcript, drops range/weight columns, prefixes code variables with c_, and returns both the cleaned data and a codebook.
- `recode`: combines selected codes into a single logical column and updates the codebook
- `view_excerpts`: create an interactive, filterable datatable to view the excerpts behind each code
- `wordcloud`: filters excerpts for a selected code, removes common stop words, and renders the result into a beautiful word cloud
- `create_code_summary` to summarize code counts and the proportion of transcripts/media objects they come from, set a min count or proportion for the summary output and plot counts, proportions or both!
- `set_saturation`: uses the output of create_code_summary to filter and visualiz codes that meet minimum appearance targets
- `compare_saturation`: builds on the same summary table to check multiple threshold sets at once - useful when you want a strict bar versus a more liberal bar. You can also plot these different bars against each other!
- `cooccurence`: helps you see which codes travel together within the same transcript or media title, building both a matrix and a network plot

## Why This Package?

Ongoing challenges in qualitative research include defining what constitutes 
high-quality data and demonstrating transparency in how saturation is 
reached (Small & Calarco, 2022). Informed by guidelines for high-quality 
qualitative research (Hennink & Kaiser, 2022), DedooseR allows you to
better understand your data with quality tags in Dedoose like:

- The **concreteness** of excerpts (priority code)
- The **heterogeneity** within codes  (heterogeneity code)

By tagging these indicators in Dedoose and exploring them in R, 
this allows for gain greater confidence in both the **depth** and **diversity** 
of datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DedooseR from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("abiraahmi/DedooseR")
```

## How do I use the package?
The vignettes walk you through how to use each of the functions, from cleaning to recoding to viewing excerpts to assessing saturation and creating code co-occurence network maps, so do check them out!
