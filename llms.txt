# DedooseR

**DedooseR** is an R package that connects with
[Dedoose](https://www.dedoose.com/) to support the analysis of
qualitative data. It was built to help researchers streamline workflows,
explore qualitative data flexibly, and conduct qualitative coding and
analysis with rigor.

## Key Features

DedooseR currently has 8 key functions that allow you to:

- `clean_data`: standardizes column names, keeps the highest ranked
  coder per transcript, drops range/weight columns, prefixes code
  variables with c\_, and returns both a cleaned dataset and codebook
- `recode_themes`: combines selected codes into a single logical column
  and updates the codebook.
- `view_excerpts`: create an interactive, filterable datatable to view
  the excerpts behind each code
- `wordcloud`: filters excerpts for a selected code, removes common stop
  words, and renders the result into a beautiful word cloud
- `create_code_summary` to summarize code counts and the proportion of
  transcripts/media objects they come from, set a min count or
  proportion for the summary output and plot counts and proportions (or
  both!)
- `set_saturation`: uses the output of create_code_summary to filter and
  visualize codes that meet minimum appearance targets
- `compare_saturation`: builds on the summary table to check multiple
  threshold sets at once - useful when you want compare a strict bar
  versus a more liberal bar. You can also plot these different bars
  against each other
- `cooccurence`: helps you see which codes travel together within the
  same transcript or media title, building both a matrix and a network
  plot

## Why This Package?

Ongoing challenges in qualitative research include defining what
constitutes high-quality data and demonstrating transparency in how
saturation is reached (Small & Calarco, 2022). Informed by guidelines
for high-quality qualitative research (Hennink & Kaiser, 2022), DedooseR
allows you to better understand your data with quality tags in Dedoose
like:

- The **concreteness** of excerpts (priority code)
- The **heterogeneity** within codes (heterogeneity code)

By tagging these indicators in Dedoose and exploring them in R, this
allows for gain greater confidence in both the **depth** and
**diversity** of datasets.

## Installation

DedooseR is currently available to install on demand, but will be more
widely accessible very soon. Email <abiraahmi.shankar@nyu.edu> if you’d
like to get your hands on it!

## How do I use the package?

The vignettes walk you through how to use each of the functions, from
cleaning to recoding to viewing excerpts to assessing saturation and
creating code co-occurence network maps, so do check them out!
