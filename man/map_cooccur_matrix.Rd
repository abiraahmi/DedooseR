\title{Plot a Code Co-occurrence Network}
\usage{
map_cooccur_matrix(
  coccur_matrix,
  edge_min = 10,
  layout = "circle",
  edge_color_low = "lightgray",
  edge_color_high = "purple",
  node_color = "lightblue"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coccur_matrix}{A square co-occurrence matrix (numeric matrix or
data frame) where rows and columns represent codes, and diagonal entries
indicate the number of transcripts in which each code appears.}

\item{edge_min}{Minimum edge weight (co-occurrence count) to retain in the
network. Edges with lower weights are removed. Default is 10.}

\item{layout}{Layout algorithm for node placement. Passed to
\code{ggraph::ggraph()}. Common options are \code{"circle"},
\code{"fr"} (Fruchterman–Reingold), or \code{"kk"} (Kamada–Kawai).
Default is \code{"circle"}.}

\item{edge_color_low}{Color for weakest edges. Default is \code{"lightgray"}.}

\item{edge_color_high}{Color for strongest edges. Default is \code{"purple"}.}

\item{node_color}{Color for nodes. Default is \code{"lightblue"}.}
}
\value{
A \pkg{ggplot2} object containing the network visualization.
Can be further customized with standard ggplot2 functions.
}
\description{
This function takes a code co-occurrence matrix (e.g., from
\code{create_cooccur_matrix()}) and produces a network visualization using
\pkg{igraph} and \pkg{ggraph}. Edges represent co-occurrence counts
(within transcripts or documents), and node sizes reflect the number of
transcripts in which each code appears.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose 'excerpts' is your dataset of coded transcripts
coccur_df <- create_cooccur_matrix(excerpts, output = "data.frame")

# Plot network with minimum edge weight of 10
map_cooccur_matrix(coccur_df, edge_min = 10)

# Use a force-directed layout instead of circle
map_cooccur_matrix(coccur_df, edge_min = 5, layout = "fr")
}
