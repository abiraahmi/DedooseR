\title{Summarize Quality Indicators Applied to Excerpts by Preferred Coders}
\usage{
quality_indicators(
  excerpts = NULL,
  preferred_coders = NULL,
  qual_indicators = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{excerpts}{A data frame containing excerpt coding data, including columns
named like \code{"Code: <Indicator> Applied"} (e.g., \code{"Code: Priority excerpt Applied"}).}

\item{preferred_coders}{A character vector specifying coder names in order of
preference. For each media title, only excerpts from the highest-ranked coder are kept.}

\item{qual_indicators}{A character vector of quality indicator code names (without
\code{"Code: "} prefix or \code{"Applied"} suffix). For example: \code{c("Priority excerpt", "Heterogeniety")}.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing counts of excerpts coded with each code, along with counts
for each specified quality indicator applied, grouped by code.
}
\description{
This function analyzes coding excerpts data, filters to keep only excerpts
from preferred coders (by their order of preference), and summarizes how
frequently specified quality indicator codes are applied to excerpts.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Validates the presence of quality indicator columns in the data.
\item Filters excerpts to only include those from the preferred coder per media title.
\item Converts wide code columns to long format.
\item Flags excerpts where each quality indicator is applied.
\item Summarizes and returns counts of how often each code appears along with counts
of quality indicators applied.
