\title{Summarize Code Counts by Coder and from Preferred Coders}
\usage{
summarize_codes(
  excerpts,
  preferred_coders = NULL,
  output_type = c("tibble", "kable", "datatable")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{excerpts}{A data frame of coded excerpts, typically read from an Excel
file.
Must include a column \verb{Excerpt Creator} indicating who coded each
excerpt,
a column \verb{Media Title} identifying the transcript,
and columns prefixed with \verb{Code:} for each code (binary indicators).}

\item{preferred_coders}{A character vector of coder names in preferred order,
used to resolve duplicates when multiple coders coded the same
transcript.}

\item{output_type}{A string indicating the output format: one of \code{"tibble"},
\code{"kable"}, or \code{"datatable"}. Defaults to \code{"tibble"}.}
}
\value{
A table summarizing the number of times each code was applied by
each coder,
including total counts from all coders and from preferred coders only.
The format depends on \code{output_type}.
}
\description{
This function summarizes how many times each code was applied by each coder,
and presents the data in a wide format: one row per code, one column per
coder,
along with two total count columns:
\itemize{
\item Total count from all coders (regardless of preference)
\item Total count from preferred coders only (one coder per media title, selected
in order of preference)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
excerpts <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/my_coded_excerpts.xlsx")
preferred_coders <- c("s", "r", "l", "a")
summarize_codes(excerpts, preferred_coders, output_type = "datatable")
}
